UX/UI-Deep-Scrutiny

I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high-quality, like Stripe-level apps.

When: When dissatisfied with UX but don't have energy to grapple with it directly
